    "While Linear Regression is suited for estimating continuous values (e.g. estimating house price), it is not the best tool for predicting the class of an observed data point. In order to estimate the class of a data point, we need some sort of guidance on what would be the most probable class for that data point. For this, we use Logistic Regression \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's recall linear regression. As we know, Linear regression finds a function that relates a continuous dependent variable, y, to some predictors (independent variables $x_1$, $x_2$, etc.). For example, Simple linear regression assumes a function of the form $y = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1  x_1 + \\theta_2  x_2 + \\cdots$, and finds the values of parameters $\\theta_0, \\theta_1, \\theta_2$, etc. It can be generally shown as: $h_\\theta(ùë•) = \\theta^TX$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a variation of Linear Regression, useful when the observed dependent variable, y, is categorical. It produces a formula that predicts the probability of the class label as a function of the independent variables. Logistic regression fits a special s-shaped curve by taking the linear regression and transforming the numeric estimate into a probability with the following function, which is called sigmoid function ùúé:\n",
    "<br>\n",

    "$$h_\\theta(ùë•) = \\sigma({\\theta^TX}) =  \\frac {1}{1 + e^{-(\\theta_0 + \\theta_1  x_1 + \\theta_2  x_2 +\\cdots)}}$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "$h_\\theta(x)$ can be interpreted as probability of a certain observation belonging to a certain class. Logistic Regression passes the input through the logistic/sigmoid but then treats the result as a probability. Sigmoid function is a common S-shape curve.\n",
